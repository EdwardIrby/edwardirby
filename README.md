**Design technologist specializing in design systems and Front-End Architecture**

### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Plaited](https://github.com/plaited/plaited)

Plaited is a fullstack framework targeting [Deno](https://deno.land/). It is design system first, design token first and leverages frontend best practices to develop highly dynamic server rendered web apps. It incorporates a reactive programming algorithm, behavioral programming combined with actor model messaging patterns and island architecture. It is designed to generate embeddings & prompts from documentation, design tokens, and component stories. A user can then query the system for information or generate interfaces using design system patterns.

- 🏋🏿‍♀ I’m currently learning to exercise regularly again 😂
